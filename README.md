# mindhive
Application for the MindHive Podcasting Network

This project is in its very basic stages. I am currently working on adding Google sign-in so I can authenticate users to access 
an Amazon S3 bucket where the .mp3 files are stored. Then, I plan on retrieving the said files and presenting them to the
user so they can download and play the podcasts. I am considering adding functionality to like & share, and adding links to the
podcasts' Twitter and Instagram accounts.

Feel free to pitch in and help!
